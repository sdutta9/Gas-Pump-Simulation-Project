# Gas-Pump-Simulation-Project

This is a Java based project that simulates the task performed by a gas pump machine. The project uses Model Driven Architecture along 
with Abstract Factory pattern, State pattern and Strategy pattern.
I created this project as part of a project work for Software System Architecture course and to understand the practicality of design 
patterns learned as part of curriculam for that course.
